# Connect net2phone to hundreds of other apps with Zapier

[Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/net2phone/integrations) lets you connect net2phone to 3,000+ other web services. Automated connections called Zaps, set up in minutes with no coding, can automate your day-to-day tasks and build workflows between apps that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

Each Zap has one app as the **Trigger**, where your information comes from and which causes one or more **Actions** in other apps, where your data gets sent automatically.
