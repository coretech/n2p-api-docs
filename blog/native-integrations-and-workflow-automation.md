# Native Integrations & Workflow Automation

It is very important to state and reinforce from the beginning that the whole point of any type of integration between applications is to build efficiency, make life easier, and automate processes to deliver a better user experience for both internal users and clients.

Philosophically, when thinking about any type of application integration, the conversations should not start with “can your application integrate with this other application?” The primary conversation should be around what the business needs and how the integration would be used. For example, instead of asking, “Do you integrate with this CRM?”, you should be asking “Can we log calls made automatically into our CRM record?”

**These questions shift the focus from the technology to the use of the technology - which is fundamental to delivering a quality experience to the user.**

From a sales and marketing perspective, any discussion around integrations should focus on real-life business needs and outcomes, not on the technology that allows for those needs to be fulfilled.

That being said, let’s make some technical clarifications to empower those business conversations.

Technically speaking there are two primary ways to create integrations. Both are built upon a common foundation of APIs, webhooks, and multiple applications.

APIs (Application Programming Interface): Multiple types of APIs can be created within an application (which we will not go into here). APIs are a complex, fully developed language for an application with functions or “calls” that allow outside apps to add, edit, and retrieve data from another application. APIs are generally not automated - but they allow for more complex transactions between applications.

Webhooks: Are less complex than APIs, and are generally focused and developed for a single function versus broad integration, and are automated.

As an analogy, let’s say that the two applications communicating with one another are neighbors.

In the first scenario let’s use APIs Integration in the analogy. Neighbor One needs eggs so they go knock on the door of Neighbor Two and ask for eggs, then if Neighbor Two has eggs they give them to Neighbor One. Then a few minutes later Neighbor One comes back to Neighbor Two and asks for flour, Neighbor Two checks and they do not have flour so Neighbor One returns home without. Later, after Neighbor One goes to the store they come back to Neighbor Two and give them back the eggs they borrowed.

In this first scenario, there is a connection that allows Neighbor One to come to ask Neighbor Two for whatever ingredient they want, to take whatever Neighbor Two has available, and then return it later if they want to or need to.

In the second scenario, let’s use a webhook in the same type of scenario. Neighbor Two knows that every time they buy eggs that Neighbor One wants eggs also. So when Neighbor Two buys eggs they send a few eggs to Neighbor One without being asked first by Neighbor One. But, they never send flour and Neighbor One never sends eggs back to Neighbor Two.

In the second scenario, the transaction is specific to eggs. And while more simple by not requiring Neighbor One to ask it is limited to the automatic delivery of eggs when they are available.
Now let’s look at the difference between the two primary types of integrations:

1. Native Application Integration: This is when one application via webhooks and APIs connects directly to another application by writing complex code that allows for bidirectional and multifunctional interactions. There is no middleware or need for functionality between the two native applications.
2. Third-party tool integration/workflow automation (like Zapier): This is when one application via webhooks or APIs allows for specific Triggers to cause specific actions via a third party application or “middleware”. This gives many opportunities to create functions and workflows without the development of complex coded language between applications but is limited to the triggers and actions made available by both the sending and receiving applications.

Back to our analogy:

In scenario 1 the native application integration the neighbors can speak directly to one another and are generally able to give and take from each other as is necessary whenever they would like.

In scenario 2 the third-party integration/workflow automation tool: The neighbors must use a delivery service and are bound to whatever the delivery service will allow them to send and receive and is automated. Meaning that when Neighbor One has eggs the delivery company comes to take the eggs and give them to Neighbor Two automatically.

In summary, both types of integration are important in today’s complex web of applications, and unique workflows based on individual businesses and their needs.

At net2phone we are working to give our clients and partners the experiences they need without letting technology get in the way. This may mean native application integration or workflow automation. Whichever way, we are here to help you focus on the actual needs of your business and to help you work more efficiently, profitably and to deliver you and your customers an exceptional communications experience.

So when thinking about how to improve your company’s workflow, don’t focus on the _how_, focus on the _why_.
